# Numbers-Flask-App
This is a Flask Web Application built in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
that utilizes the Numbers API (numbersapi.com) to create an application
that allows users to simply learn new, unique, and interesting facts by 
simply tying in a number or allowing the application to randomly select
numbers and provide facts about them. It's a way for the people to expand
their knowledge of the world in a much easier and user-friednly way.
