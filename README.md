# Numbers-Flask-App
This is a Flask Web Application built in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
that utilizes the Numbers API (numbersapi.com) to create an application
that allows users to learn new, unique, and interesting facts by simply 
tying in a number or allowing the application to randomly select numbers 
and provide facts about them. It's a way for the people to expand
their knowledge of the world in a much easier and user-friendly way. You
can visit the web application at https://numbers-facts-app.herokuapp.com/
